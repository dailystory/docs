# Technical Setup Guide
This setup guide, designed for configuring advanced options for your use of DailyStory, requires some IT or technical knowledge. If this doesn't describe you, just [drop us a note](mailto:hello@dailystory.com).

## Add a custom subdomain
Setting up a subdomain to point to DailyStory enables content hosted by DailyStory, such as your landing page, to appear as part of your domain.

* [Instructions for configuring a custom subdomain](/install/subdomain)

### Optionally configure Email and a Domain
You can start using DailyStory without setting up email or a custom domain. Email will be sent on your behalf through DailyStory's email system and your pages and content will be hosted on DailyStory's domain.

People that receive your email will see the message as coming from:
	
`Anna Jones <anna@example.com> on behlaf of DailyStory`

Landing pages or other content hosted on DailyStory will look like:
	
`https://dlystr.io/Sample-landing-page?_UID=4933ca402181fcf4a5c94713daaa9921`

To configure your own email account and subdomain, please [follow the steps in our technical setup guide](/install/setup)
