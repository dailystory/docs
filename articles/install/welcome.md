# Welcome to the DailyStory Campaign Attribution Platform
DailyStory includes everything you need to track and engage prospective customers and attribute them to the campaign they originally converted on.

> This content will disappear as soon as you start using DailyStory.

## Getting Started

You can find the DailyStory tracking tag on the user drop down when you are signed in to DailyStory:
![Tracking Tag](https://docs.dailystory.com/articles/install/install-01.png "Tracking Tag")

This will take you to the Account Settings > DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page:
![DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page](/articles/install/install-02.png "DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page")

> The Site ID, which is already included in the JavaScript tracking code, is a unique identifier that helps DailyStory know data is coming from your website.

The DailyStory JavaScript tracking code should be added to any pages within your website, community or landing pages where you want to enable DailyStory functionality. 

## Installation Guides
You can [install the tracking code manually](/install/manual) or follow one of our installation guides:

* [SquareSpace](/install/squarespace)
* [WordPress](/install/wordpress)
