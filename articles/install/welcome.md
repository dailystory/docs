# Welcome to the DailyStory Campaign Attribution Platform
DailyStory includes everything you need to track and engage prospective customers and attribute them to the campaigns they participated in.

## Add the DailyStory Tracking Tag
DailyStory collects visitor information from your website and can integrate with your existing web forms. But first you must [add the DailyStory tracking tag](https://docs.dailystory.com/install) to your website.

You can find the DailyStory tracking tag on the user drop down (top right of this page):
