# Installing the DailyStory Tracking Code
The DailyStory tracking code, also called a tracking tag, is a small piece of JavaScript that needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of all your web pages.

> The DailyStory tracking tag is similar to other tags, such as Google Analytics.

You can find the DailyStory tracking tag on the user drop down when you are signed in to DailyStory:
![Tracking Tag](/articles/install/install-01.png "Tracking Tag")

This will take you to the Account Settings > DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page:
![DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page](/articles/install/install-02.png "DailyStory Site ID and Tracking Code page")

> The Site ID, which is already included in the JavaScript tracking code, is a unique identifier that helps DailyStory know data is coming from your website.

The DailyStory JavaScript tracking code should be added to any pages within your website, community or landing pages where you want to enable DailyStory functionality.
