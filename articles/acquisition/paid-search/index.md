# DailyStory Paid Search Tracking Links
DailyStory Paid Search is similar to DailyStory [Tracking Links](/link-tracking/). It enables you to track how link clicks convert visitors into customers. 

Paid Search links offer two differences from standard Tracking Links:

* **Budget Management** provide the approximate budget for your ads and DailyStory will calculate the cost per-qualified customer.
* **Keyword tracking** the ability to track the keyword a visitor converted on.

> Paid Search Tracking Links include tracking templates for both Google AdWords and Microsoft Bing Ads. Using these tracking templates you get the ability to track the keywords, device type and other information.

## Setting up DailyStory Paid Search Tracking Link

A Paid Search Tracking Link provides 3 URLs for you to use.

1. **Tracking Link URL** similar to a [Tracking Link](/link-tracking/) you can use this URL anywhere to track visitor conversions from ads.
2. **Google AdWords Tracking Template** a special tracking link for Google AdWords that adds keyword and device data from Google AdWords.
3. **Bing Ads Tracking Template** a special tracking link for Google AdWords that adds keyword and device data from Bing Ads.

## Tracking Link URL
The Tracking Link URL is a URL that you can use to track link clicks from any ad campaign or activity other than Google AdWords or Bing Ads.

For example, if you are running a Facebook Ad campaign, use the Tracking Link URL.
