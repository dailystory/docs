#Contacts
A DailyStory Contact is a customer or prospective customer managed by DailyStory. 

While there is only a single contact for an individual managed by DailyStory, the contact may be part of multiple campaigns. For example, a contact can be subscribed to a newsletter, part of a nuturing drip campaign, and part of a new membership email sequence.

A [lead](/leads) represents the contact within a specific campaign. When viewing a contact you can see the campaigns that contact is part of.

## Importing Contacts
To bulk import contacts use the [import contacts](import) tool.
