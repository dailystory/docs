#Contacts
A DailyStory Contact is a customer or prospective customer managed by DailyStory. 

While there is only a single contact for an individual managed by DailyStory, the contact may be part of multiple campaigns. For example, a contact can be subscribed to a newsletter, part of a nuturing drip campaign, and part of a new membership email sequence.

A [lead](/leads) represents the contact within a specific campaign. When viewing a contact you can see the campaigns that contact is part of.

##All Contacts
To view all of your contacts click Contacts > All Contacts. You will be presented with a list all contacts.

From All Contacts you can select contacts and add them to a Campaign or Segment.

Going through a list of contacts one by one to add them to your campaigns or segments is slow. Instead, you can filter the contacts shown using search.

###Searching and Filtering All Contacts
To quickly search your contacts you can type any text into the quick search text box. 

This will search across all contact fields and return any matches. For example, if you search for "Dallas" it may return people who's first name is Dallas and people who live in the city Dallas.

While useful, sometimes you want to get more specific about the type of contacts you want to filter or types of people you want to exclude. For example, search for contacts that are male, younger than 25, and live within 15 miles of Seattle, Washington.

To accomplish this, first click on Advanced Search. This presents specific fields that you can search through.

Using the options in Advanced Search you can narrow your list of contacts to only those that specifically match the criteria you are looking for.

After completing the form and clicking search, the URL of the browser contains the search parameters. This is useful because you can save the URL, share the URL, and more advanced users modify the URL directly.

Contacts can have user defined attributes. Enterprise customers of DailyStory can configure those properties for search. When the user defined attribute is searchable it is available in advanced search.

For example, if your contact data is augmented with income data and is made available to search, you will find the field in advanced search.
