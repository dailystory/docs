# Search
DailyStory includes powerful search tools. These search tools enable you to quickly and efficiently search through thousands of [Contact's](/contacts) and save the results as [Dynamic Segments](/segments/).

In addition to searching standard fields, such as first and last name, DailyStory Search is capable of searching custom fields added to your contacts. This capability enables you to add, through import or sync, any number of custom fields specific to your business. These fields include: strings, lists, numbers and dates.

> Custom fields are only available for Professional and Enterprise licensees.

This guide provides a list of resources to help you get started with search.

**Frequently Asked Questions**


## Simple Search
Finding a contact or contacts that match text within the contact is simple: Navigate to Contacts > All Contacts and type your search into the search box. For example, to find any contact with the word "Smith":

![Basic Search](/articles/contacts/search-01.png "Basic Search")

A simple search, such as the example above, will search through all of the searchable fields on the contact: name, company, description, etc.

## Wildcard Search
Sometimes searching by exact text, such as "Smith", doesn't find the results you need. Instead maybe you want to find everyone that has "Smi". For example, "Smith", "Smithe", "Smiley". To accomplish this type of search use the '*' to indicate a wild card search: `Smi*`.

If you want to search for all results that start with "Sm" and end with "h", use the '?' to indicate matches for any character. For example, `Sm??h` returns results for any contact that has a word that starts with "Sm" and ends with "h".

> A search cannot start with a wildcard. Doing so will result in an error message.

## Advanced Search
In addition to searching all fields of a contact, you can also search for text in specific fields.

In the examples, above we searched for "Smi*". But were we looking for people whose last name was Smith, email addresses that contained the word Smith, or for companies with Smith in their name?

To search a specific contact field, click the "Advanced Search" link. This will open the Advanced Search menu:
