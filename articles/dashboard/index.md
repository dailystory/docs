#Dashboard
When you first sign in to DailyStory you will be presented with a dashboard. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of account information, menu shortcuts, and new leads to help you quickly understand how you are performing.

## Visitor Information
The top of the dashboard provides a quick view list of traffic and lead performance related metrics:

* Landing Page Visitors - visitors to your landing pages for the past 30 days.
* Clicks - number of clicks from your email links for the past 30 days.
* Messages Sent - number of emails sent over the past 30 days.
* New Leads - the number of unique leads created across all campaigns for in the past 30 days.

Next, you are presented with 8 short cut menu buttons for easy access to your DailyStory feature areas.

Finally, you are presented with a graph representation of your New Leads and a list organized by the most recent.  In this list you will be able to quickly scan the asset that created the lead, campaign it's associated with, any automated scoring assigned, the date created and the last date seen.

## Leads
The Leads graph provides a visual view of the number of visitors you have converted into identified accounts over the past 60 days.

In addition to providing a visual overview, you can click on a point in the graph to drill down into that particular day to get more detail. This will open the [Conversion Rate Funnel report](/articles/reports/conversion-rate-funnel).
