# DailyStory Email Marketing
Email Marketing is used to send personalized email to your [Segments](/segments) and [Contacts](/contacts) as part of a [Campaign](/campaigns). Emails are either sent based on a [Schedule](/campaigns/schedules) or a [Workflow](/campaigns/workflows).

DailyStory tracks and attributes delivery, bounces, opens, clicks, and optouts automatically.

Emails are sent through the @dailystory.net mail server. However, we strongly recommend configuring a custom domain to allow DailyStory to send email securely on your behalf or leverage DailyStory's [Mailgun](/integrations/mailgun), SendGrid or PostMark integrations.

> The benefit of using an integrated transactional email platform to send your email is you can configure your own sending email domain. If not, your email send address will appear as `sales@example.com on behalf of @dailystory.net`

## Create an Email
To create an email, first navigate to Content > Emails. This will display All Emails. From here you can select an existing email to edit or click the menu button ![Menu Button](/articles/emails/emails-01.png "Menu Button") and click `+ Create Email`.

![Emails Menu](/articles/emails/emails-01.png "Email Menu")

Next, 

## Edit an Email



Clicking on any of the numbers for Delivered, Opened, Clicked and Bounced will [open reports](#email-reporting) for the email.

![All Emails](/articles/emails/emails-02.png "All Emails")

Clicking + New Email will open up the New Email editor. When the page opens you will first need to select the [campaign](/campaigns) the email will be associated with.

> If you create an email in one campaign and want to use it in another campaign, just edit the email and click 'Create a Copy'

After selecting a campaign, you will be presented with the DailyStory email editor:

![New Email](/articles/emails/emails-03.png "All Email")

The email editor has 3 tabs and you can use any of them for authoring your email.

* **Live Edit** - provides a view similar to what your final email will look like.
* **Rich Edit** - provides a rich, WYSIWYG editor with helpful toolbars for common formatting options.
* **HTML (Advanced)** - edit the raw HTML used in your email.

> For sending HTML emails, be sure and include the  `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html> <head> <body>` tags.

On the right you will find a list of [merge tags](/reference#merge-tag) that you can use within your email. 

DailyStory makes extensive use of merge tags throughout the product and whenever possible we provide a list of the merge tags available.  

Finally, you can also select an [email template](/features/email-templates). An email template enables you to create a re-usable layout. If you select an email template, you only need to provide the content in the email body.

### Required Email Fields
DailyStory Emails require you provide a from address, a subject and a body. The To is automatically set for you.

#### To
The To: address will be set automatically when the email is used within a workflow or sent via the API. 

If a contact only has an email address, only the email address will be used. If the contact has a first or last name the email will be formatted as `First Last <email@example.com>`.
#### From
The From address must be a valid email address. For example:

* <code>Renew your membership &lt;sales@somecorp.com&gt;</code>
* <code>Rob Howard &lt;rob@dailystory.com&gt;</code>
* <code>hello@dailystory.com</code>

> A good best practice is to use a descriptive name in the from if the email isn't coming from a person.
#### Subject
The Subject should be a descriptive introduction to the body of your email message. The subject may contain merge tags.
#### Body
The Body of your email contains the message you want to send. The body may contain merge tags.

> While it is possible to edit the HTML of the email and use style sheets, be aware that it is best to use inline styles as most email clients do not recognize style sheets.

### Email Merge Tags
In both the subject and body of your email you can include Merge Tags:
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Merge Tag</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|FNAME|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's first name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|LNAME|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's last name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|FULLNAME|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's full name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|COMPANY|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's company name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|EMAIL|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's email address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|DATE|*</code></td>
<td>The current date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|TIME|*</code></td>
<td>The current time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|TITLE|*</code></td>
<td>The recipient's title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|LOGO|*</code></td>
<td>The logo configured for your tenant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="25%" nowrap><code>*|UNSUBSCRIBE|*</code></td>
<td>An unsubscribe url</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> Important, if an <code>\*|UNSUBSCRIBE|\*</code> merge tag is not found an unsubscribe link will automatically be included in the email. An unsubscribe header with this link is also sent as part of the email - these are best practices to ensure the email is not flagged as SPAM.

Any merge tags used in the email that doesn't exist for the contact you are sending to is automatically removed.

For example if the <code>\*|FNAME|\*</code> merge tag was used, but the contact does not have a Firstname field this:	 <code>Hi \*|FNAME|\*</code> Becomes: <code>Hi</code>

Merge tags provide a simple way to personalize your email, but do have limitations. For more robust personalization of your [email use personalization templates](https://www.dailystory.com/features/personalized-email-marketing/#templating-in-your-personalized-email-marketing).

### Email Personalization Templates
Personalization templates provide all the same functionality as merge tags for personalization. 

> Personalization Templates don't exist for merge tags such as <code>\*|BODY|\*</code>, <code>\*|WEBVIEW|\*</code>, <code>\*|UNSUBSCRIBE|\*</code>.

Personalization templates use a separate format. For example, to insert the user's first name use <code>{{user.firstname}}</code>

## Advanced Options
DailyStory includes advanced options for emails such as setting an email preheader and including a web view of the email.

### Setting an Email Preheader
The majority of email clients provide a snippet of text to preview the contents of an email in your inbox. This enables you to quickly scan your inboxÂ and decide if you want read, save, or archive the email.

This inbox preview text can be set using an [email preheader](https://www.dailystory.com/blog/email-preheader-improve-open-rates/).

To set an email preheader click the Advanced Options tab. There you'll find an option to set the preheader.

![PreHeader Text](/articles/emails/emails-12.png "PreHeader Text")

This will include a hidden HTML div in the body of your email:
	
<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;div class="preheader" style="display:none !important;
visibility:hidden !important;
mso-hide:all !important;
font-size:1px;
overflow:hidden !important;
display:none !important;"&gt;
The contents of your preheader text
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

### Enabling Email Web View
A web view of your email enables people to click a link in your email and view the email in a web browser.

> By default web view is disabled and no web view is available for your email.

To enable a web view of your email first enable the web view by clicked the toggle button on the Advanced Options tab:
	
![Enable Web View](/articles/emails/emails-13.png "Enable Web View")

Next, use the <code>\*|WEBVIEW|\*</code> merge tag to include a link in your email.

> Note, the <code>\*|WEBVIEW|\*</code> merge tag only inserts the URL.

Optionally use the preview link next to the web view toggle button to preview what the web view of your email looks like. It will be personalized using the [Test Contact](/reference#test-lead).

The web view of the email is unique to each recipient. If personalization or merge tags are used in the email people who view the link will see the personalized view.

## Testing your Email
There are several options for testing emails. You can create a test campaign, add your email as a workflow and then add leads to the campaign. However, to test only the email, just use the Send a test email button in the email editor.

### Send a test email
Use the Sent a test email button to send yourself (or someone else) a test email.

> Important, you must save your email prior to sending a test email. Test emails count towards your monthly send limits.

![Send test email](/articles/emails/emails-04.png "Send test email")

Clicking Send a test email will open up a window. Enter a valid email address to send your test email to.

![Test email recipient](/articles/emails/emails-05.png "Test email recipient")

The test email will use the [Test Contact](/reference#test-lead) for any merge fields found in the email.

### Email Addresses DailyStory Ignores
For testing and demonstration purposes you can use recipient addresses ending in <code>@test.com</code> and <code>@example.com</code>. These email addresses do not count towards your license limits and these emails will never be sent.

If you want to test sending emails, such as running a test lead through a workflow, we recommend using a disposable email address such as <a href="http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fake Mail Generator</a>.
