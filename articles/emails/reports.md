> You can also click on Opened, Clicked, and Bounced for each email in the All Emails page to view who opened the email, clicked on a link in the email or bounced. These reports are also accessible as links in the Email Delivery Report.

The report provides several graphs to help you visualize your email delivery performance. 

The first graph, shown in the image above, details sent/deliver/bounced along with % delivered for the selected date range.

Next, you will find a graph detailing delivered/opened emails. You can also click on the link in the graph to see who opened the email.
