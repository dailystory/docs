# DailyStory Quick Start: Getting Started with DailyStory
Welcome to DailyStory! We put this guide together to help you get started using DailyStory.

The good news is you don't need a degree in computer science to start using DailyStory. And, you won't need a team to setup and manage DailyStory. We've built it to be simple.

> See the [Technical Setup Guide](/install/setup) for advanced setup options such as setting up a custom subdomain or custom email address.

But before you get started you will need to add the DailyStory tracking tag to your website. The tracking tag connects DailyStory and your website and is required to use many of the features of DailyStory.

<ol class="step"><li value="1">Install the Tracking Tag</li></ol>
The tracking tag is a small piece of JavaScript that needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of all your pages.

Follow these instructions to [install the DailyStory tracking tag](/install). 

> The DailyStory tracking tag is similar to other tags, such as Google Analytics.

We have instructions for [installing the tracking tag manually](/install/manual) as well as using our [WordPress plugin](/install/wordpress).

* [Tracking Tag Frequently Asked Questions](/install#Frequently-Asked-Questions)

<ol class="step"><li value="2">Create a Campaign</li></ol>
Once you have the tracking tag setup, you'll want to [create some campaigns](/campaigns/#creating-a-campaign).

> Note, the number of campaigns is limited by your license

Everything in DailyStory is associated with a campaign. For example, if you have a set of customers that you want to enroll in a drip campaign, send emails for a new trial, or track signups on a form, you'll first need a campaign.

And creating a campaign is easy.

We recommend you create campaigns for any marketing activity you want to track or measure. Such as a newsletter campaign, contact us campaign, or adwords campaign.

> When you create any new assets, such as an [Email](/emails/), [Tracking Link](/link-tracking/), or [Landing Page](/pages/) you'll be prompted to either select a campaign or quickly create a new one.

<ol class="step"><li value="3">Create a Lead in your Campaign</li></ol>

Leads are created in your campaigns in several ways:
	
* **Manually** using the + Add Lead button and completing the Create Lead form.
* **Contact Import** [bulk importing new contacts](/contacts/import) and assigning the imported contacts to a campaign.
* **Forms** when visitors complete either a [Web From](/acquisition/web-forms/) or [Magic Form](/acquisition/magic-forms/).
* **Popups** when visitors share their email address in a [popup](/acquisition/popups/).
* **API** when the API is used to create a new lead, such as through [Zapier integration](/integrations/zapier/).

> There is a [contact](/contacts/) for every lead. A contact who is in a campaign is called a lead.

For example, if you have a Newsletter Signups campaign and Elon Musk signs up for your newsletter you will see a new lead in your Newsletter Signups campaign.
