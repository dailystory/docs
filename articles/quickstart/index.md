# DailyStory Quick Start: Getting Started with DailyStory
Welcome to DailyStory! We put this guide together to help you get started using DailyStory.

It helps to follow along with a DailyStory account. If you don't have a DailyStory account, you can  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailystory.com/trial">create a 21-day trial to start</a>.

<ol class="step"><li value="1">Install the Tracking Tag</li></ol>

While the trial does include some sample data, to begin using your 30-day trial on your own website, you'll need to install [install the DailyStory tracking tag](/install). 

The tracking tag is a small piece of JavaScript that needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of all your pages.

> The DailyStory tracking tag is similar to other tags, such as Google Analytics.

We have instructions for [installing the tracking tag manually](/install/manual) as well as using our [WordPress plugin](/install/wordpress).

<ol class="step"><li value="2">Create a Campaign</li></ol>
Once you have the tracking tag setup, you'll want to [create some campaigns](/campaigns/#creating-a-campaign).

> Note, the number of campaigns is limited by your license

Everything in DailyStory is associated with a campaign. For example, if you have a set of customers that you want to enroll in a drip campaign, send emails for a new trial, or track signups on a form, you'll first need a campaign.

And creating a campaign is easy.

We recommend you create campaigns for any marketing activity you want to track or measure. Such as a newsletter campaign, contact us campaign, or adwords campaign.

> When you create any new assets, such as an [Email](/emails/), [Tracking Link](/link-tracking/), or [Landing Page](/pages/) you'll be prompted to either select a campaign or quickly create a new one.

<ol class="step"><li value="3">Create a Lead in your Campaign</li></ol>

Leads are created in your campaigns in several ways:
	
* **Manually** using the + Add Lead button and completing the Create Lead form.
* **Contact Import** [bulk importing new contacts](/contacts/import) and assigning the imported contacts to a campaign.
* **Forms** when visitors complete either a [Web From](/acquisition/web-forms/) or [Magic Form](/acquisition/magic-forms/).
* **Popups** when visitors share their email address in a [popup](/acquisition/popups/).
* **API** when the API is used to create a new lead, such as through [Zapier integration](/integrations/zapier/).

> There is a [contact](/contacts/) for every lead. A contact who is in a campaign is called a lead.

For example, if you have a Newsletter Signups campaign and Elon Musk signs up for your newsletter you will see a new lead in your Newsletter Signups campaign.
