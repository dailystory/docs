## Name and Logo
The name of your account may be changed, but a name is required. 

While not required, it's strongly encouraged to set a logo.

Setting the logo for your account will enable DailyStory to use your logo when sending notification emails and other places through-out DailyStory.

Once uploaded, the logo will be resized to conform to no more than 300px tall and 140px wide. This is to ensure the logo is displayed properly.

> When DailyStory resizes your logo some quality may be lost. It is better to upload a logo that conforms to the dimensions.

## Enable or Disable the DailyStory Tag
Use the Account toggle to enable or disable the DailyStory [Tracking code](/install). 

This will prevent DailyStory's tag from collecting data from your site, disables all APIs, and disables all other features such as [Tracking Links](/link-tracking/), [Magic Forms](/acquisition/magic-forms/) and [Popups](/acquisition/popups/).

## Fiscal Year and Week Start
Fiscal Year and Week Start are not currently used within DailyStory. However, these features will be used in the future for reporting.

## Timezone
The timezone determines how dates and times are shown and is also required when creating scheduled activities (emails, text messages, and so on). If your [personal timezone](/account/personal-settings#timezone) is not set, DailyStory will default to the Account's timezone. If timezone is not set in Account Settings or Personal Settings, DailyStory will default to UTC time.

## Account Owner
The Account Owner is the individual identified as the primary account owner. 

The account owner cannot be removed from the list of [Users](/account/users). And the account owner is always given administrator access when roles are enabled.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does my uploaded image appear blurry?
If you uploaded a large image, DailyStory will resize your image to fit the recommended dimensions. However, when this resize occurs it can impact the quality of your image. If you can, it is best to export an image from a graphic program (or request one from your designer) constrained to the recommended dimensions.
