# Account Settings
Accounts Settings enable you to configure options related to your tenant within DailyStory. This includes setting such as account name, logo and more.

![Account Settings](/articles/account/settings-01.png "Account Settings")

The name of your account may be changed, but providing a name is required. In this section you can also disable your account. This will prevent DailyStory's tag from collecting data from your site, disables all APIs, and disables all other features such as [Tracking Links](/link-tracking/), [Magic Forms](/acquisition/magic-forms/) and [Popups](/acquisition/popups/).

## Logo
Setting the logo for your account will enable DailyStory to use your logo when sending notification emails and other places through-out DailyStory.

Once uploaded, the logo will be resized to conform to no more than 300px tall and 140px wide. This is to ensure the logo is displayed properly.

> While not required, it's strongly encouraged to set a logo.

## Fiscal Year, Week Start and Timezone
All of these settings help DailyStory display information correctly within the application. Settings such as Timezone are especially important for scheduling and reporting.

## Account Owner
The Account Owner is the individual identified as the primary account owner. The account owner cannot be removed from the list of [Users](/account/users). And the account owner is always given administrator access when roles are enabled.
